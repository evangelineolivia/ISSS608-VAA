Based our your critique, create an improved version of the data visualization.\n\n## Peer Review\n\nThis review is based on one of my classmate submission which is available at [here](https://isss608vaarajesh01.netlify.app/takehomeexercises/take_homeexercise1/take_homeexercise1)\n\n## The Data\n\nThe dataset titled “Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024”, published by the [Department of Statistics Singapore (DOS)]((https://www.singstat.gov.sg/)) was used for our class assignment\n\n## Loading Packages\n\nBelow is the package that was downloaded by the peer.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nHere is some additional packages that I use for this peer review :\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nI notice that there is some missing library to make the plot (dplyr)\n\n## Loading Data\n\nThe code chunk below loads the data. I’ve prepared two datasets, one for the original plot and another is for the makeover.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noriginaldata <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesex2024.csv\")\n\nmakeover <- read_csv(\"data/respopagesex2024.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Visualization Review\n\n### Visualisation 2: Top 10 Planning Areas by Total Population\n\n#### The Original Visualization\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntop_pa <- originaldata %>%\n  group_by(PA) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop)) %>%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Pop)) %>%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nggplot(top_pa, aes(x = reorder(PA, Total_Pop), y = Total_Pop)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Populous Planning Areas (2024)\",\n       x = \"Planning Area\", y = \"Total Population\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-Home_Ex01Feedback_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Makeover Visualization\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Feedbacks\n\n### Good Design Points :\n\n1.
