    "text": "Visualization Review\n\nVisualisation 2: Top 10 Planning Areas by Total Population\n\nThe Original Visualization\n\ntop_pa &lt;- originaldata %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Pop)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nggplot(top_pa, aes(x = reorder(PA, Total_Pop), y = Total_Pop)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Populous Planning Areas (2024)\",\n       x = \"Planning Area\", y = \"Total Population\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeedbacks\n\n\nOverall Rating – Quadrant III:\n\n\nReferring to the Clarity vs. Aesthetics framework by Ben Jones, I would place this chart in Quadrant III, which represents visualizations that are both confusing and unattractive. Visually, the chart could be enhanced with better spacing, labeling, and color contrast to improve its aesthetic appeal and overall clarity.\n\nGood Design Points :\n\n1. Well Ordered from Highest Population to Lowest\n\nThe bars are arranged in descending order, starting from the planning area with the highest population at the top to the lowest at the bottom. With this type of ordering it helps the audience especially for general readers to quickly grasp the ranking of each area without the need to compare individual values. Thus, this type of graph enhance the readanility and allows easy visual comparison across planning areas.\n\n2. Clear Axis Label\n\nBoth the x-axis and y-axis title are clearly labeled which ensure the readers can immediately understand what the chart is showing without additional need of explanation.\n\n3. Horizontal Layout \n\nUsing horizontal bars is well considered design choice, especially dealing with long category names such as “Jurong West” and “Choa Chu Kang”. If the writer decided to use vertical bar charts, lenghty category names often will become overlaped which can significantly reduce readability.\n\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\n1. X-Axis Values Format\n\nI believe as a general audience especially for those who does not have any mathemathical background, scientific notation like 1e+05 would be hard to understand and confusing. It is not immediately clear so instead I would suggest using some basic mathemathical formatting like (comma) would be more friendly and easier to interpret for general audience.\n\n2. Lack of Data Labels on Bars\n\nIn this case, since the chart is presented using a static chart (without interactive features), as an audience it is impossible for us to know the exact population per planning areas. As a result this chart becomes somewhat limited in usefulness eventhough it clearly shows the ranking of the planning area. In my opinion, adding data labels would greatly enhance the clarity and make the chart more informative.\n\n3. Monochromatic Color Scheme\n\nSince the chart uses a single color (steelblue) for all bars, it is harder to distinguish or emphasize which one is the top ranked area. In my opinion choosing this kind of visualization makes a limitation for the visual impact. Including color variation (gradient) based on the population size would make the chart more engaging and help the readers to draw attention to the most important values.\n\n\n\nMakeover Visualization\n\ntop_pa &lt;- makeover %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = \"drop\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total_Pop)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\nggplot(top_pa, aes(x = reorder(PA, Total_Pop), y = Total_Pop, fill = Total_Pop)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = comma(Total_Pop)), hjust = -0.1, size = 3.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma, expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.15))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Most Populous Planning Areas (2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Source: Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)\",\n    x = \"Planning Area\", \n    y = \"Total Population\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#D6EAF8\", high = \"#154360\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 14),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10))\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfill = Total_Pop was added inside aes() to create a color gradient that represents population.\ngeom_text(aes(label = comma(Total_Pop)), ...) was added to display population values on each bar.\nscale_y_continuous(labels = comma, expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.15))) was added to format the y-axis with commas instead of scientific notation and also expand the axis range so that the text labels per bar could fit into the chart.\nscale_fill_gradient(low = \"#D6EAF8\", high = \"#154360\") was added to apply gradient color scheme to the bars.\nThe labs(..., subtitle = \"Source: Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS), ...)\" was also added to provide data source information so that the reader could understand the credibillity of the chart."

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots, ggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and\ncolorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or - color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) + \n  geom_density_ridges(rel_min_height = 0.02) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If we have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) + \n  geom_density_ridges(rel_min_height = 0.02) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If we have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()+\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2.

Several ggplot2 extensions offer tools for combining multiple plots into a single figure.\nFirst, let us create three statistical graphics:\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"#A94442\", \n                 fill=\"#DBA39A\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"#A94442\", \n                 fill=\"#DBA39A\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")+\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\ntag_levels = ‘I’tag_levels = ‘A’tag_levels = ‘1’\n\n\n\n((p1/p2)|p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1+p2)/p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'A')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1/p2)|p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = '1')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, left = 0.02, bottom = 0.7, right = 0.5,top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\nggrepel\nggthemes\nhrbrthemes\nggplot tips: Arranging plots\nggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration\nggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet"

    "text": "Animated graphics are often more engaging and impactful than static ones when presenting a visual data story. In this hands-on exercise, I will learn to:\n\nCreate animated data visualisations using the gganimate and plotly packages\nReshape data using the tidyr package\nProcess, wrangle, and transform data using the dplyr package\n\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, a frame shows data at a specific time or for a specific category. As the frame changes, the graph updates accordingly.\nAnimation Attributes: These are settings that control the animation’s behavior—such as frame duration, transition style (easing), and whether the animation starts fresh or continues from the current frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment.\nHowever, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org. We just want to use its country_colors scheme.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\n\n\npacman::p_load(readxl, gifski, gapminder,\n               plotly, gganimate, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_each_(funs(factor(.)), col) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nread_xls() of readxl package is used to import the Excel worksheet.\nmutate_each_() of dplyr package is used to convert all character data type into factor.\nmutate of dplyr package is used to convert data values of Year field into integer.\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, mutate_each_() was deprecated in dplyr 0.7.0. and funs() was deprecated in dplyr 0.8.0. In view of this, we will re-write the code by using mutate_at() as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear') +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic.

    "text": "Animated graphics are often more engaging and impactful than static ones when presenting a visual data story. In this hands-on exercise, I will learn to:\n\nCreate animated data visualisations using the gganimate and plotly packages\nReshape data using the tidyr package\nProcess, wrangle, and transform data using the dplyr package\n\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, a frame shows data at a specific time or for a specific category. As the frame changes, the graph updates accordingly.\nAnimation Attributes: These are settings that control the animation’s behavior—such as frame duration, transition style (easing), and whether the animation starts fresh or continues from the current frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment.\nHowever, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."
