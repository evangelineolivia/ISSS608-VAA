    "text": "Animated graphics are often more engaging and impactful than static ones when presenting a visual data story. In this hands-on exercise, I will learn to:\n\nCreate animated data visualisations using the gganimate and plotly packages\nReshape data using the tidyr package\nProcess, wrangle, and transform data using the dplyr package\n\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, a frame shows data at a specific time or for a specific category. As the frame changes, the graph updates accordingly.\nAnimation Attributes: These are settings that control the animation’s behavior—such as frame duration, transition style (easing), and whether the animation starts fresh or continues from the current frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment.\nHowever, if we are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org.

It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\n\n\n\nShow Code\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear') +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#FEFCF3\",color = NA))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic.

The output is then saved as an R object called gg.\nggplotly() is then used to convert the R graphic object into an animated svg object.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot.
